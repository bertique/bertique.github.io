 I'm an advocate for life long learning. I've found [MOOC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) classes to be a great resource.
 Recently completed [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) courses include:
 
 +  [UX Design for Mobile Developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud849)
 +  [Developing Android Apps](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853)
