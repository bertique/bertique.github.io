Welcome to my brand new website+blog! I've been wanting to do this for a while now, and finally have found a place to put up some of the [projects I'm working](/#projects) on in my spare time. I will also publish blog posts every once in a while. For more frequent updates, check out [my twitter](https://twitter.com/midi2dot0).

I've been contemplating building my own site every so often, but never found quite the right outlet. Most options I was familiar with, were either too complicated for my small use case, or too simple and looked like a generic site.

I was looking for a solution that would:

1. Support a simple **page and blog**
2. Be **customizable** down to the html/css/js
3. Work on a **low budget**

With Jekyll I found exactly what I was looking for. From the [Jekyll homepage](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/):

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory containing raw text files in various formats, runs it through Markdown (or Textile) and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, ready-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your favorite web server. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your project’s page, blog, or website from GitHub’s servers for free.

So far I started with the default Jekyll page and applied a custom bootstrap theme to it. Over time I plan on adding more features. You can check out the [source of my page on GitHub](https://github.com/bertique/bertique.github.io).

Some resources I found useful to get started:

* [My github page repository](https://github.com/bertique/bertique.github.io)
* [Jekyll project page](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Liquid template reference](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers)
* [Markdown reference](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)
* [Github pages for Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)
* [Bootstrap themes](http://www.blacktie.co/)
