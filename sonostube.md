excerpt: |
 I love my [Sonos](sonos.com) wireless music system. Inspired by the work of [Rahim S](http://www.hirahim.com/blog/2014/07/10/shutting-down-soundcloud-on-sonos/), I'm currently working on integrating YouTube into Sonos using the [Sonos API](musicpartners.sonos.com) as well as the YouTube API.
 
 More infos coming soon.
